# Problem : Lemonade Change
# Problem Statement : At a lemonade stand, each lemonade costs $5. Customers are standing in a queue to buy from you and order one at a time (in the order specified by bills). Each customer will only buy one lemonade and pay with either a $5, $10, or $20 bill. You must provide the correct change to each customer so that the net transaction is that the customer pays $5.
# Note that you do not have any change in hand at first.
# Given an integer array bills where bills[i] is the bill the ith customer pays, return true if you can provide every customer with the correct change, or false otherwise.
class Solution:
    def lemonadeChange(self, bills: list[int]) -> bool:
        cnt5, cnt10 = 0, 0
        for b in bills:
            if b == 5:
                cnt5 += 1
            elif b == 10:
                if cnt5 > 0:
                    cnt5 -= 1
                    cnt10 += 1
                else:
                    return False
            else:
                if cnt10 > 0 and cnt5 > 0:
                    cnt10 -= 1
                    cnt5 -= 1
                elif cnt5 > 2:
                    cnt5 -= 3
                else:
                    return False
        return True
