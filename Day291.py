# Problem : Parallel Courses III
# Problem Statement : You are given an integer n, which indicates that there are n courses labeled from 1 to n. You are also given a 2D integer array relations where relations[j] = [prevCoursej, nextCoursej] denotes that course prevCoursej has to be completed before course nextCoursej (prerequisite relationship). Furthermore, you are given a 0-indexed integer array time where time[i] denotes how many months it takes to complete the (i+1)th course.
# You must find the minimum number of months needed to complete all the courses following these rules:
# You may start taking a course at any time if the prerequisites are met.
# Any number of courses can be taken at the same time.
# Return the minimum number of months needed to complete all the courses.
# Note: The test cases are generated such that it is possible to complete every course (i.e., the graph is a directed acyclic graph).
