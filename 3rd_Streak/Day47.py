# Problem : Minimum Cost to Hire K Workers
# Problem Statement : There are n workers. You are given two integer arrays quality and wage where quality[i] is the quality of the ith worker and wage[i] is the minimum wage expectation for the ith worker.
# We want to hire exactly k workers to form a paid group. To hire a group of k workers, we must pay them according to the following rules:
# Every worker in the paid group must be paid at least their minimum wage expectation.
# In the group, each worker's pay must be directly proportional to their quality. This means if a workerâ€™s quality is double that of another worker in the group, then they must be paid twice as much as the other worker.
# Given the integer k, return the least amount of money needed to form a paid group satisfying the above conditions. Answers within 10-5 of the actual answer will be accepted.

class Solution:
    def mincostToHireWorkers(
        self, quality: List[int], wage: List[int], k: int
    ) -> float:
        n = len(quality)
        worker = [[w / q, q] for w, q in zip(wage, quality)]
        worker.sort()
        quality_sum = 0
        heap = []
        for ratio, q in worker[:k]:
            quality_sum += q
            heappush(heap, -q)
        pay = worker[k - 1][0] * quality_sum
        for ratio, q in worker[k:n]:
            heappush(heap, -q)
            quality_sum += q + heappop(heap)
            pay = min(pay, quality_sum * ratio)
        return pay
