# Problem : Buddy Strings
# Problem Statement : Given two strings s and goal, return true if you can swap two letters in s so the result is equal to goal, otherwise, return false.
# Swapping letters is defined as taking two indices i and j (0-indexed) such that i != j and swapping the characters at s[i] and s[j].
# For example, swapping at indices 0 and 2 in "abcd" results in "cbad".

    def buddyStrings(self, s: str, goal: str) -> bool:
        n = len(s)
        if s == goal:
            return len(set(s)) < len(goal)

        i = 0
        j = n - 1

        while i < j and s[i] == goal[i]:
            i += 1

        while j >= 0 and s[j] == goal[j]:
            j -= 1

        if i < j:
            s_list = list(s)
            s_list[i], s_list[j] = s_list[j], s_list[i]
            s = ''.join(s_list)

        return s == goal
