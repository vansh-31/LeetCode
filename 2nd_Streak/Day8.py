# Problem : Find the Duplicate Number
# Problem Statement : Given an array of integers nums containing n + 1 integers where each integer is in the range [1, n] inclusive.
# There is only one repeated number in nums, return this repeated number.
# You must solve the problem without modifying the array nums and uses only constant extra space.
class Solution:
    def findDuplicate(self, nums: list[int]) -> int:
        n = len(nums)
        slow = nums[0]
        fast = nums[0]
        while True:
            slow = nums[slow]
            fast = nums[nums[fast]]
            if slow == fast:
                break
        slow = nums[0]
        while slow != fast:
            slow = nums[slow]
            fast = nums[fast]
        return slow
