# Problem : Minimum Number of Arrows to Burst Balloons
# Problem Statement : There are some spherical balloons taped onto a flat wall that represents the XY-plane. The balloons are represented as a 2D integer array points where points[i] = [xstart, xend] denotes a balloon whose horizontal diameter stretches between xstart and xend. You do not know the exact y-coordinates of the balloons.
# Arrows can be shot up directly vertically (in the positive y-direction) from different points along the x-axis. A balloon with xstart and xend is burst by an arrow shot at x if xstart <= x <= xend. There is no limit to the number of arrows that can be shot. A shot arrow keeps traveling up infinitely, bursting any balloons in its path.
# Given the array points, return the minimum number of arrows that must be shot to burst all balloons.
class Solution:
    def findMinArrowShots(self, points):
        if not points:
            return 0
        arrows = 1
        points.sort()
        start, end = points[0]
        for i in range(1, len(points)):
            if points[i][0] >= start and points[i][0] <= end:
                end = min(end, points[i][1])
            else:
                arrows += 1
                end = points[i][1]
            start = points[i][0]
        return arrows
