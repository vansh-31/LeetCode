# Problem : Check If Two String Arrays are Equivalent
# Problem Statement : Given two string arrays word1 and word2, return true if the two arrays represent the same string, and false otherwise.
# A string is represented by an array if the array elements concatenated in order forms the string.
class Solution:
    def arrayStringsAreEqual(self, word1: list[str], word2: list[str]) -> bool:
        return "".join(word1) == "".join(word2)
