# Problem : Path with Maximum Probability
# Problem Statement : You are given an undirected weighted graph of n nodes (0-indexed), represented by an edge list where edges[i] = [a, b] is an undirected edge connecting the nodes a and b with a probability of success of traversing that edge succProb[i].
# Given two nodes start and end, find the path with the maximum probability of success to go from start to end and return its success probability.
# If there is no path from start to end, return 0. Your answer will be accepted if it differs from the correct answer by at most 1e-5.
